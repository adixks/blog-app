# blog-app
###Description
####The blog application allows you to create and manage posts, such as creating, editing, deleting, or viewing a list. Additionally, there is a function to add a new post author.

####The application is divided into 3 layers: web, service and repository.

####Data saved in the database (Author and Post) may differ from what is displayed, which is why I am using Entity and Model. It uses Mapper to switch between models.

###Technologies:
####Maven
####JUnit 8 (given, when, then)
####Git
#### h2database 2
